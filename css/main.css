/*  Using multiple CSS files allows us to break up our css into more readable/managable sections
that pertain to each section of the webpage we're working on. We can inport each css file that 
we create into a 'main.css' file. This is the file that we link inside our HTML, and when read,
it imports all of our css files that we import into main.css file*/
